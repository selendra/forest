# Substrate Forest Parachain Template

A new [Forest](https://github.com/selendra/forest/)-based Substrate node, ready for hacking ☁️..

This project is originally a fork of the
[Substrate Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)
modified to include dependencies required for registering this node as a **parathread** or
**parachain** to a **relay chain**.

The stand-alone version of this template is hosted on the
[Substrate Devhub Parachain Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-parachain-template/)
for each release of Polkadot. It is generated directly to the upstream
[Parachain Template in Forest](https://github.com/paritytech/forest/tree/master/parachain-template)
at each release branch using the
[Substrate Template Generator](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-template-generator/).
